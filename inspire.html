					She inspires me because:
				
					</h2> 
							<ul>
								<li>She always believed in the power of young people to change the world</li>
								<li>Her lessons of living are: to show kindness, love unconditionally, live with dignity and grace</li>
								<li>Charitable work, and giving to others is important</li>
								<li>Success is not final; failure is not fatal: it’s the courage to continue that counts.</li>

        		The Princess of Wales but also known as "The Queen of people's hearts..." And honestly, I can't think of a better title for her. A true example of grace, emapthy, humanity and kindness. 
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		A woman,a mother, a princess who didn't accept the world around her the way it was. And she easily could. She didn't have to care about people behind the walls of Buckingham palace. Buy yet, she cared. She believed she can make a difference. To me she is an example of a true leader.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		One of her messages for the world was:“It really doesn’t matter what you wear or how you do your hair,” said Diana. “What matters is who’s inside the clothes and their heart.” And I couldn't agree with her more.
