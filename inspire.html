    		<h1>Princess Diana</h1>
    		<p>
        		The Princess of Wales but also "The Queen of people's hearts..." And honestly, I can't think of a better title for her. A true example of grace, emapthy, humanity and kindness. 
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		A woman,a mother, a princess who didn't accept the world around her the way it was. And she could. She didn't have t care about people behind the walls of Buckingham palace. Buy yet, she did. She believed she can make a difference. To me she is an example of a true leader.
    		</p>
   <p>
        		Here is also why she still ispires me: 
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>She always believed in the power of young people to change the world</li>
        		<li>Her lessons of living are:to show kindness, love unconditionally, live with dignity and grace</li>
        		<li>Charitable work, and giving to others is important</li>
        		<li>Success is not final; failure is not fatal: it’s the courage to continue that counts.</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		One of her messages for the world was:“It really doesn’t matter what you wear or how you do your hair,” said Diana. “What matters is who’s inside the clothes and their heart.” And I couldn't agree with her more.
