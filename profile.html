    <p> I am an international student-athlete here at UNC who is majoring in Management and minoring in Digital Marketing. I am a swimmer for UNC's Swim and Dive team. I was born and raised in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Southeastern Europe. While I was a senior in high school I've received an offer for full scholarship here at UNC and that is how my college adventure on another continent began.</p>
    <p> Another side of me, when I am not all wet and in a swimsuit, is that I am a huge shopaholic. I love fasnion and just shopping in general. I also love to travel and I have a bucket list of all the places I want to visit. I already visited every continet except Australia, so that one is on the top of my list. I jsut love different cultures and meeting new people, and to be honest, I LOVE trying new food.</p>
