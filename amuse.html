        <h1>Good Comedy Movie</h1>
        <p>Something that amuses me are movies. I love to watch a good comedy, or since I am a typical girl, even a romcom. Therefore, I use Netflix a lot. </p>
    <p>I use it probably a little too much, even though I don't have time for that. But hey, who doesn't need a good laugh to get them through the day</p>
    <p>One of my favorite comedy movies you can find on Netflix, and it's called "Police Academy". I probably watched it too many times, but it still makes me laugh just like the first time I've seen it.</p>

        <h2>Top Laugh</h2>
    <p>When I think of funny videos on the web, I love the one with puppies. In general, I think puppies are funn as much as they are cute, and they are pretty goofy. So, enjoy a few minutes of cuteness.</p>
